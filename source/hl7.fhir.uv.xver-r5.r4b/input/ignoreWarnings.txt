# ==== 04. We are faithfully reproducing existing Code Systems and cannot address these ====
CODESYSTEM_CONCEPT_NO_DEFINITION
HL7 Defined CodeSystems should ensure that every concept has a definition
CODESYSTEM_CONCEPT_NO_DISPLAY
HL7 Defined CodeSystems should ensure that every concept has a display
CODESYSTEM_CS_COMPLETE_AND_EMPTY
When a CodeSystem has content = 'complete', it doesnt make sense for there to be no concepts defined
CODESYSTEM_CS_HL7_MISSING_ELEMENT_SHOULD
HL7 Defined CodeSystems SHOULD have a stated value for the hierarchyMeaning element so that users know the status and meaning of the code system clearly
CODESYSTEM_PROPERTY_CODE_DEFAULT_WARNING
The type of property 'code' is 'code', but no ValueSet information was found, so the codes will be validated as internal codes
CODESYSTEM_PROPERTY_UNKNOWN_CODE
This property has only a code ('%') and not a URI, so it has no clearly defined meaning in the terminology ecosystem
CODESYSTEM_PROPERTY_URI_INVALID
The uri '%' for the property '%' implies a property with that URI exists in the CodeSystem FHIR Defined Concept Properties for http://hl7.org/fhir/concept-properties, or the code '%' does, but neither were found
CODESYSTEM_THO_CHECK
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

VALIDATION_VAL_STATUS_INCONSISTENT
The resource status 'active' and the standards status 'draft' are not consistent
The resource status 'draft' and the standards status 'normative' are not consistent
ERROR: % If a resource is not implementable, is marked as experimental or example, the standards status can only be 'informative', 'draft' or 'deprecated', not 'trial-use'.
VALIDATION_VAL_STATUS_INCONSISTENT_HINT
The resource status 'draft' and the standards status 'trial-use' may not be consistent and should be reviewed
WARNING: %: The property '%' has no definition in CodeSystem.property. Many terminology tools won't know what to do with it

","Value must have at least these property values","Specifies a value that each occurrence of the element in the instance SHALL follow - that is, any value in the pattern must be found in the instance, if the element has a value. Other additional values may be found too. This is effectively constraint by example.  

When pattern[x] is used to constrain a primitive, it means that the value provided in the pattern[x] must match the instance value exactly.

When an element within a pattern[x] is used to constrain an array, it means that each element provided in the pattern[x] must (recursively) match at least one element from the instance array.

When pattern[x] is used to constrain a complex object, it means that each property in the pattern must be present in the complex object, and its value must recursively match -- i.e.,

1. If primitive: it must match exactly the pattern value
2. If a complex object: it must match (recursively) the pattern value
3. If an array: it must match (recursively) the pattern value

If a pattern[x] is declared on a repeating element, the pattern applies to all repetitions.  If the desire is for a pattern to apply to only one element or a subset of elements, slicing must be used. See [Examples of Patterns](elementdefinition-examples.html#pattern-examples) for examples of pattern usage and the effect it will have.","`ElementDefinition.pattern[x]` maps to R4 `ElementDefinition.pattern[x]`.

Other additional values may be found too. This is effectively constraint by example.  

When pattern[x] is used to constrain a primitive, it means that the value provided in the pattern[x] must match the instance value exactly.

When an element within a pattern[x] is used to constrain an array, it means that each element provided in the pattern[x] must (recursively) match at least one element from the instance array.

When pattern[x] is used to constrain a complex object, it means that each property in the pattern must be present in the complex object, and its value must recursively match -- i.e.,

1. If primitive: it must match exactly the pattern value
2. If a complex object: it must match (recursively) the pattern value
3. If an array: it must match (recursively) the pattern value

If a pattern[x] is declared on a repeating element, the pattern applies to all repetitions.  If the desire is for a pattern to apply to only one element or a subset of elements, slicing must be used. See [Examples of Patterns](elementdefinition-examples.html#pattern-examples) for examples of pattern usage and the effect it will have.","`ElementDefinition.pattern[x]` maps to R4 `ElementDefinition.pattern[x]`.
